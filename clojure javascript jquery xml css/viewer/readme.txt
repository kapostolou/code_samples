A javascript and css graphical tool depicting the chosen geometrical testing functions for each pair of objects, where the objects is using a "collision tag", which associates it with a set of properties (such as the rigid boddy type, the coarse collision bounding shape, wether penetration will be allowed or the physics system will resolve collisions, if no testing should be done for optimization, and if the collisions "kill" either or both of the objects). The properties are described in clojure associative arrays and then an ad hoc hierarchical rules matching system produces the necessary calls for each pair. The clojure files are given in the folder xml file generation. The javascript/jquery code is in the viewer folder (along with the current generated xml files) and can be opened directly in Firefox (other browsers only load from a web server served page).

The sample geometry code includes geometrical functions that are chosen based on the data in  the xml files, in an initalization procedure that loads the xml data to construct arrays of callbacks (Func<Collidable,Collidable,Result>) which are used to enable double dispatch on the pairs of objects during the runtime. The double dispatch runs in the IntersectionGrid.InsertCollidable function which gets a collidable places it on the spatial partitioning grid and incrementaly checks it for collisions on the objects already there.
